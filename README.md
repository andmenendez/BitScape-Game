#### How to play and what parts of the level to observe technology requirements
BitScape can be played using a mouse or game controller. A player can start a new game in the main menu. Once a new game is started the player is redirected to the level1 scene which contains two levels. Upon completion of the two levels a new level is presented.

#### Known problem areas
- The agent that helps the player to solve the first level can discharge before the player reaches the second activator in the first level. Some players struggle with this part but they eventually found out that this is an expected behavior.
- Menu options for adjusting sound can sometimes scroll using only the keyboard/controller. It looks like the position of the player is affecting the menu slider options.
- Audio for footsteps only works for one animation-set (when not grabbing an object)
- Movement animation is a bit inconsistent
